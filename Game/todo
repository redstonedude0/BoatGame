Alpha 0.6 (The Control Update): [TODO]
[R]	Make controls be based on how they will affect motion
		i.e. right will always make you turn right?

			d alone will set up thrusts to clockwise rotation
			w and d will set up thrusts to forward and clockwise
			e alone will set up thrusts for rightward translation
[R]	Make camera follow boat (following COM? linear soft follow? bounded? sigmoid? hard? Rotation?) [discussion]
[R]	Check that block masses are working properly
Alpha 0.7 (The Worlds Update): [TODO]
[R]	If it will be server-side, make the server [test server connection with other game + discuss hacking prevention]
		when a client connects they can request 1,2,3,4 as a raft and use it as normal
		central server? client-run servers? local play?
[R]	Add world saving (save raft location etc)
	[decide how barrel spawning should work]
	[discuss disconnection whilst in a server - 'ghost' ship raidable?]

	Implement PCE stats system [walk speed, swim speed]
	Add construction time (make construction a lasting task)
	Make thrusters require 2 wood
	Make intelligent task selection (take into account distance, swim/walk speeds)
	If a task would require dismounting a boat moving at more then 1ms^-1 then set it as unreachable
	Add character status effects (cold, wet) gained from swimming, lost over time
	Add paddelling task, must be placed adjacent to empty spot, can be rotated
	Paddelling task is cancellable, make all other tasks cancellable
	Implement paddelling, take it into account for control and physics calculations.

	Add larger worldmap, openable in the GUI.
	Add scrolling to world scale
	Add GUI scale into a graphics settings page?

Alpha 0.91 (The Sounds Update): [TODO]
	Decide on sound design
	Make the music and sounds as necessary
	Add a way to trigger sounds and music on events in the code
Alpha 0.92 (Company Setup): [TODO]
	Set up the company or whatever we need to do
		I would like us to have a corporate meme because then we can be like a real company meme
		Perhaps we could in-corporate (ayy lmao) our names into the company name? HCH Games or something along those lines.
	Set up a bank that is in the company/corporate name
	Create an automated banking system so that shares of the money are debitted as we earn?
	Decide how much the game should be worth. I think that we should go around the £7-£13 bracket. Discuss this.
	Marketing - do we want to use advertisements? Facebook Page, Twitter, etc. Get PC Gamer to do a piece on it if poss? Send review copies
		to YouTubers?
	[R]: Could do, corporate meme might be a little harder on the paperwork side, idk tho, and need £40 to register as a Private Limited Company.
			Defo sounds like it'd be cooler tho, and yeah I dig HCH games, we just gotta argue over which H is which XD.
			As for automated banking that could be a good meme, the only issue might be that we need to deduct some cut to pay
			for dedis before the share split, so have to consider that. Also need to discuss which shares who is getting in this meme.
			Yeah i definitely think free review copies to a load of youtubers is a good idea. I was thinking aim it for like 9.99 to start,
				bear in mind we get 70% after tax so that'd be like £6 profit per sale maybe, which isn't too bad.
			Need to consider the whole steam meme - it'd cost £100 just to put the game on steam, however Java isn't natively compatible
			with the steam API. We'd have to use a JNI to interface with the Steamworks API, which considering we might use an external
			launcher anyways there's gonna be alot of external library memes. The only other alternatives are to either rewrite the entire
			thing in C. Which isn't happening. Or to use web APIs and OPENID to authenticate the users, however they will have to
			enter their steam details into our game in order to do that.
			
			Ait just gone and done some testing, got launch4j packing the .jar into a .exe just fine but I think we need to get steamworks
			before we can look at interfacing the steam API properly. However I did get it to compile fine with steamworks4j.
Alpha 1.0 (Initial Gameplay): [TODO]
	Clean up menus and everything to make it somewhat playable
	Begin paperwork for Steam direct steamworks (requires atleast 5 days review, 30 days processing, 2 weeks "coming soon")
	Test the game works on other platforms (other windows, mac, etc)
	Consider adding a launcher (detects java version, splashscreen built in, etc)
Alpha 1.1 (The Floating Update): [TODO]
	Add buoyancy mechanics, possibly consider how capsizing will work?
	Add mechanics for a player to restart from scratch if needed
	[discuss and implement mechanics for how more PCEs can be obtained?]
	Implement reefs
	Add mechanics for flooding and hull leakage, add collisions with islands and reefs
Alpha 1.2 (The Fleet Update): [TODO]
	Add mechanics to have multiple ships, and assigning PCEs to different boats?
	[discuss how boat assignment will work, color coded tasks for different boats?]
	Add boarding plank to allow PCEs to transfer between rafts
	Add Anchor to keep rafts in place
	[begin discusson on how different resources will be obtained]
Alpha 1.3 (The Boat Update): [TODO]
	Add multilevelling so boats can be created.
	Add stairs to transfer between levels
	Discuss how water level can be displayed, consider adding a captains controller
		which adds GUI nautical information
	Consider how this will impact 2.5D
	Ensure boarding planks have the correct physics for this, consider adding a GUI element to compare vertical levels?
	Consider stability and how that will affect capsizing
	[discussion of pre-generated structures such a strongholds, ports, and dry docks]
Alpha 1.4 (The Fighting Update): [TODO]
	Implement hand-to-hand combat and pistols, perhaps give every PCE infinite ammo and a pistol by default.


	
#Leave room here for future alpha iterations, testing and implementing minor features until it is ready for release

Ideas
	Camera control
		Camera centres on player
			If player starts to drive a raft, the camera zooms out and recentres on the raft
		Camera can be set to centre on other rafts through binds (e.g. F1 for boat 1, F2 for boat 2, etc)
		Camera can be set to 3 modes - rotate with entity, rotate on click and drag, or fixed
		Click and drag may not be necessary or good
		
	Player control
		Under fixed cam
			Twin stick - wasd for movement, mouse for look (like hotline miami)
		Under rotate with entity
			wasd where a and d turn
		Under click and drag
			wasd for movement and click and drag for turn


Beta 1.0 (Public Gameplay): [TODO]
	Release the game on steam in a playable format
Beta 1.1 (Tidying up): [TODO]
	Add Controller support
	Use user feedback to debug
Beta 1.2 (The Modding Update): [TODO]
	Decide on modding platform
		Steam Workshop
		Nexus Mods (Dusk preference on this platform - nexus is really nice and well-used by the modding community - especially for skyrim and
			fallout)
		Custom Platform?
		Other...
	Add ability to mod in a viable way
	Create a mod forum?
