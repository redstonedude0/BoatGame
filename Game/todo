What is required to be updated for each release:
Alpha 0.1 (The Physics Update):
[R]	Basic physics engine sorted
Alpha 0.2 (The Looks Update):
[R]	Fix physics engine so COM moves in straight line
[R]	Add handling for textured tiles
Alpha 0.3 (The Menu Update): [TODO]
[R]	Add temporary main menu and loading screens, add splash screens
[R]	Add escape menu to return to main menu and shutdown internal engine
	[begin discussion about whether local play should be a thing, discuss servers]
	[discuss how buttons should work]
	[discuss how screen scalar should work]
	[discuss lwjgl, discuss 2D 3D]
[R]	Make outboard motor graphical orientation be based on thrust angle
Alpha 0.4 (The Vector Update): [TODO]
[R]	Create VectorDouble and handlers to represent vectors and transformations
[R]	Replace the physics engine with VectorDouble objects
	[discussion of legal stuff, set up company?]
[R]	Implement friction being applied based on relative velocity
	[needs deeper testing, consider adding static friction? Possibly add matrix objects?]
Alpha 0.5 (The Debug Update): [TODO]
[R]	Add functions to allow for easy debug, add a debug menu, add debug options to show moments? (added vector display)
[R] Add more vecor helper functions
Alpha 0.6 (The Control Update): [TODO]
[R]	Make controls be based on how they will affect motion
		i.e. right will always make you turn right?
		how to implement:
			w alone will set up thrusts to thrust forward
			d alone will set up thrusts to clockwise rotation
			w and d will set up thrusts to forward and clockwise
			e alone will set up thrusts for rightward translation
[R]	Make camera follow boat (following COM? linear soft follow? bounded? sigmoid? hard? Rotation?) [discussion]
[R]	Check that block masses are working properly
Alpha 0.7 (The Worlds Update): [TODO]
	If it will be server-side, make the server [test server connection with other game + discuss hacking prevention]
		when a client connects they can request 1,2,3,4 as a raft and use it as normal
		central server? client-run servers? local play?
	Add world saving (save raft location etc)
	[decide how barrel spawning should work]
	[discuss disconnection whilst in a server - 'ghost' ship raidable?]
	[discuss ship destruction, abandonment, and hacking reporting systems?]
	Add noisemap to represent small islands and land masses
	Display islands based on noisemap
	Save noisemap to world when world saves
[D] Add sounds
Alpha 0.8 (The Entities Update): [TODO]
	Add barrel entities
	Add player controlled entities, more can be spawned by a button press in debug menu
	Player controlled entities can walk around
	Player controlled entities walk across water to fetch barrels
	Player controlled entities walk back to boat 0,0 plank when there are no tasks
	Add GUI for building floors and thrusters, as well as assigning barrels to be collected
	Allow floors and thrusters to be built instantly from 1 wood, which each barrel grants to each PCE
	Task selection is done randomly
Alpha 0.9 (The Intelligence Update): [TODO]
	PCEs wander around the raft when they have nothing to do
	Implement server-side chat?
	[decide how PCE stats should work, random? guaranteed for 1st person? etc]
	Implement PCE stats system [walk speed, swim speed]
	Add construction time (make construction a lasting task)
	Make thrusters require 2 wood
	Make intelligent task selection (take into account distance, swim/walk speeds)
	If a task would require dismounting a boat moving at more then 1ms^-1 then set it as unreachable
	Add character status effects (cold, wet) gained from swimming, lost over time
	Add paddelling task, must be placed adjacent to empty spot, can be rotated
	Paddelling task is cancellable, make all other tasks cancellable
	Implement paddelling, take it into account for control and physics calculations.
		Paddelling will apply a force proportional to the difference in speed from 1ms^-1, it will never accelerate above 1ms^-1
Alpha 0.91 (The Sounds Update): [TODO]
	Decide on sound design
	Make the music and sounds as necessary
	Add a way to trigger sounds and music on events in the code
Alpha 0.92 (Company Setup): [TODO]
	Set up the company or whatever we need to do
		I would like us to have a corporate meme because then we can be like a real company meme
		Perhaps we could in-corporate (ayy lmao) our names into the company name? HCH Games or something along those lines.
	Set up a bank that is in the company/corporate name
	Create an automated banking system so that shares of the money are debitted as we earn?
	Decide how much the game should be worth. I think that we should go around the £7-£13 bracket. Discuss this.
	Marketing - do we want to use advertisements? Facebook Page, Twitter, etc. Get PC Gamer to do a piece on it if poss? Send review copies
		to YouTubers?
Alpha 1.0 (Initial Gameplay): [TODO]
	Clean up menus and everything to make it somewhat playable
	Begin paperwork for Steam direct steamworks (requires atleast 5 days review, 30 days processing, 2 weeks "coming soon")
	Test the game works on other platforms (other windows, mac, etc)
	Consider adding a launcher (detects java version, splashscreen built in, etc)
Alpha 1.1 (The Floating Update): [TODO]
	Add buoyancy mechanics, possibly consider how capsizing will work?
	Add mechanics for a player to restart from scratch if needed
	[discuss and implement mechanics for how more PCEs can be obtained?]
	Implement reefs
	Add mechanics for flooding and hull leakage, add collisions with islands and reefs
Alpha 1.2 (The Fleet Update): [TODO]
	Add mechanics to have multiple ships, and assigning PCEs to different boats?
	[discuss how boat assignment will work, color coded tasks for different boats?]
	Add boarding plank to allow PCEs to transfer between rafts
	Add Anchor to keep rafts in place
	[begin discusson on how different resources will be obtained]
Alpha 1.3 (The Boat Update): [TODO]
	Add multilevelling so boats can be created.
	Add stairs to transfer between levels
	Discuss how water level can be displayed, consider adding a captains controller
		which adds GUI nautical information
	Consider how this will impact 2.5D
	Ensure boarding planks have the correct physics for this, consider adding a GUI element to compare vertical levels?
	Consider stability and how that will affect capsizing
	[discussion of pre-generated structures such a strongholds, ports, and dry docks]
Alpha 1.4 (The Fighting Update): [TODO]
	Implement hand-to-hand combat and pistols, perhaps give every PCE infinite ammo and a pistol by default.

	
	
#Leave room here for future alpha iterations, testing and implementing minor features until it is ready for release


Beta 1.0 (Public Gameplay): [TODO]
	Release the game on steam in a playable format
Beta 1.1 (Tidying up): [TODO]
	Add Controller support
	Use user feedback to debug
