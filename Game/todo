			On the next pathfinding tick they will update their state.
		Efficiency enhancements:
	[R]	  Change everything to use floats instead of doubles? NO. Changed everything to use doubles only.
			Investigate speed and accuracy difference?
			floats are VERY marginally faster in some circumstances, however at the cost of signifiant accuracy. DO NOT USE FLOAT.
		Error handling:
	[R]	  Wrap packet handlers in try catches to prevent thread crashes [disconnect client]
	[R]	  Move createNewListener server-side to playerJoin to fix comod exceptions
		PCE Stats sytem:
	[R]	  Implement PCE stats system [walk speed, swim speed]? Implemented WS=0.1, SS=0.08 for all characters
		Task System Updates:
	[R]	  Overhaul task system
	[R]	  Add construction time (make construction a lasting task)
	[R]	  Add repair task? [automatically added? option in GUI?]
			Automatically adds repair task, no option currently. Consider if block doesn't exist, consider removing if block is
			destroyed. Consider adding better listeners and possibly a wrapper for Tiles
	[R]  Update Wander task to account for characters being in water.
			Allows them to reside on a fake square at 0,0 however.
	[R]	  Make tasks cancellable by right-clicking? Note: Repair tasks won't cancel currently due to auto-creation
	[R]	  Make intelligent task selection? (take into account distance, swim/walk speeds)
			Priority for each task from getPriority() method, lowest priority is done first. (must be >=0)
	[R]	  Intelligent dismounting (pathfinding not currently necessary)
	[R]	  Consider adding try-catch around all execute()s to ensure that pathfinding is fine, else set as unreachable?. Task will be
			cancelled upon error.
	[R]	  Implement custom Priority class where you have PriorityType (Critical, Normal, Low), and a int priorityModifier. Allows more
			in-depth setting of Priorities (i.e. repairs always come above building, etc)

	[R]	  Add GUI to show list of tasks, etc
    [R]	  Modified debug GUI so its visible
    [R]	  Made escape menu a GUI
		Camera Updates:
	[R]	  Update Camera to be able to track other objects (need objects to track, allow for tracking of entities?)
	[R]   Rotation soft follow?
	[R]	Investigate barrel 'worm' at t=0
		  Investigation so far - it still exists, not sure how to reproduce it though. Possibly always in direction of wind?
		  Caused by destruction of a raft in a previous safe. Not sure why.
		  Caused when NaN as a barrel spawn location is cast to 0 as an int, so (50?) barrels spawn at origin.
		  Will be automatically fixed when NaN issue is solved.
	[R]	Investigate black flash when resizing frame
		  Investigation 1 - Not found, possibly solved with new fps method
		  Inv 2 - "". Not found marked as completed.
	[R]	Investigate 1 frame flash when clicking GUI buttons
		  Investigation 1 - Not found, possibly solved with new fps method
		  Inv 2 - "". Not found marked as completed.
	[R]	Investigate ghost damage from barrels
			Appears to occur as 1 client doesn't acknowledge a barrel dissapearing, make sure only doing collisions for own raft
	[R]	Investigate raft reset to 0,0 on disconnect?
			Caused by non-synchronous methods, fixed.
	[R]	Investigate Socket write errors on disconnect? Added better handling on disconnect server-side.
	[R]	Investigate barrel clicking not being 100% accurate on small view
			possibly due to the null errors that were fixed with null checks and a sync. Probably not.
			Investigation 1 - not found; possibly fixed
			Investigation 2 - found, source not identified. Checked code - no reason why it shouldn't work. Possibly sync bug.
			Investigation 2 - Upon creating task removal it appears tilestates are sent every tick?
	[R]	Investigate Task delay - takes a second to take up a task? (due to random selection each time - should be fixed with
			priority system implementation). With new system task delay is near 0.
	[R]	Investigate task speed reduction
			Improved graphics display method to reliably achieve 40-50fps. Consider seperating graphics and physics into seperate
			thread or pseudo-seperate threads.
	[R]	Consider implications of making join and disconnect synchronized now, consider other ways around this, consider removing
			"socket closed" error on server shutdown. "socket closed" fixed, making methods synced should be fine. Need to consider
			full queueing system.
	[R]	Consider event listeners
	[R] Investigate thrust selection system (forward also applies translation). Fixed system by implementing effectiveZero.
	[R]	Fix NaN errors on raft (check before and assert after, if the variable turns NaN, find out where and what caused it, then
			search for the causal variable. If the variable is NaN and Nan then its broken outside of physics update by that
			variable). Caused by a divide-by-zero on VectorDouble, modified it to return (0,0) on 0 divisor.
Alpha 1.0 (The Sounds Update): [In Progress]
		PR:
	[D)	  Create PR accounts (Twitter, fb? etc)
			Need a company email.
				This means I need to get a domain.
					-Use GoDaddy and use an external website designer and etc (Very, very costly)
					-Use a website creator (Costly)
					-Use GoDaddy and point to a webserver and then set up an email server (Second cheapest)
					-Use G-Suite (Cheapest? (GoDaddy + servers may be cheaper overall)
			Once the domain is set up, I can then create twitter, set up a website, etc.
				Tools to bear in mind
					-Manuscript
					-G-suite
					-Webs
					-GoDaddy
	(D)	  Get feedback from Alpha 0.9 and suggest features
	(D)	  Get feedback from Alpha 0.9 and begin to outline a financial strategy
		Graphics & Sound:
	(D)	  Decide on sound design
			See file
	(D)	  Make the music and sounds as necessary
			Plan to use open source sfx for the time being, but should be able to at least create some midis or tracks for music
	(D)	  Animations
	[R]     See animation specification below (approx. line 260)
-D-	(D)	  Add sounds for character walking+swimming. Discuss how to - possibly hook into moveToward function
	(RD)  Add a way to trigger sounds and music on events in the code - Discuss how music system might work
-D-	(DR)  Discuss potentially moving to multiple different spritesheets
		Data type cleanup:
-P-	(R)	  Overhaul rest of packet and physics system to work with Location better.
	(R)	  Add helper methods to Location to calculate distances, get movespeed type, etc
-P-	(R)	  Consider adding .send() to packets?
	(R)	  Reorganise packet structure so shared, server, and client, resources are seperate where required.
		Task system changes:
-P-	(R)   Consider cancelling wander task on tile destruction - consider adding predicate shouldRemove handler?
-PR-(R)	  Add paddelling task, must be placed adjacent to empty spot, can be rotated
-P- (R)	  Investigate cancelling tasks (no longer happens as all tasks are Task - consider adding a checkTarget method)
-D-	(R)	  Consider priority handling for non-collective destruction? Consider resource dropping
-PR-(R)	  Implement paddelling, take it into account for control and physics calculations. Paddelling will apply a force proportional to the difference in speed from 1ms^-1, it will never accelerate above 1ms^-1 Perhaps set as unreachable if speed difference is too great?
-PD-(R)	  If a task would require dismounting a boat moving at more then 1ms^-1 then set it as unreachable Consider implications of mid-journey speed-ups. Need to add failure to move into characters moveToward method.
	(R)	  Currently cannot cancel a task if it is in progress
		Interface and Camera changes:
-PD-(R)	  Consider adding drag interface for multiple task creation/deletion
-P-	(R)	  Investigate mouse being very slightly off with mouse interface
-PD-(R)   Consider queueing input controls
-PD-(R)	  Add scrolling to world scale? Consider effects of tile graphics
-PR-(R)	  Add a hard render limit on ships+entities to save GPU, also add fog of war to show approximately this limit (-20 perhaps?), limit focussed on camera?
	(RD)  Investigate latency issues. Consider measuring packets, consider writeUnshared testing. Consider offloading packet transfer to client-side calculations. esp. for AI. Need to analyse WAN latency. (consider UDP packets)
-PD-(R)	  Add GUI scale into a graphics settings page?
-PD-(R)	  Implement server-side chat? Need to decide how to handle focus & modification of chatqueue
-D- (R)	  Consider allowing for a delocalised camera
		Resource System:
-PD-[R]	  Decide how to implement resource requirement system + other resources, consider TileHandler and enums
-D-	[R]	  Create resource management system so resources are stored if not needed
			Need to decide how to implement. How to make tasks modular and piecewise, perhaps have each task be
				simple (reach location, gather material, etc), and/or be a supertask (reachlocation() gathermaterial()).
				Perhaps rather than extending or implementing they extend task but include variables for the tasks
				so TaskReachEntity has an instance of TaskReachLocation which it updates and modifies as needed, its execute
				then simple points to TRLs execute.
-PR-[R]	  Make thrusters require 2 wood
	[R]	  Make it so you can see what resources you have as an overlay
	[R]	  Make it so you can recruit new characters on islands - should it be a task? Better name than 'characters'
	[R]   Make it so you spawn with a number of starting characters
-D-	(R)	  Consider effects of syncing tiles, consider adding seperate methods to dictate state variables, or some handling to
			request the states rather than set them
-D-	[R]	  Consider the effects of infinitely holding a task and implementation of wandering.
			Added ineligiblity to constructino task
	[R]	  Add ability to destroy resources

		World gen and map:
-D-	(R)	  Trees, foliage, etc?
-D-	(R)	  Polygonal islands with perlin noise generation. How to implement?
	[R]	  Make the map show other players and update live
		Misc:
-P-	[R]	  Investigate coordinates in Character menu - not using COM pos?
	(R)	  Make entities a ConcurrentLinkedQueue, remove getters and setters as they are no longer needed
	(R)	  Consider List syncing on player join - how to avoid duplicate entries?
	(R)	  Consider packet ordering to ensure that null entries don't occur with player movement packets etc? re-queue?
	(R)	  Consider character levels (officers, captains, etc)
	[R]	  Fixed drag system - could not set magnitude < 0 in VectorDouble.

	Further notes for this update (and future updates):
		Resources:
			Wood - obtained in barrels on the ocean, obtained from trees on islands
			Scrap Metal - obtained in barrels on the ocean, can be found on beaches
			Cloth - obtained in barrels on the ocean, can be obtained from cotton plants on islands?
			(Characters) - recruited from islands? Can just be grabbed? (should be task) Need to be bribed with food? Can be taken prisoner?
			Food? - Can go fishing? Can grab fruit from islands? Required to nourish and keep characters (they die or revolt without food?)
			Coral - Can be collected from reefs, used as weaponry and armor?
			Stone blocks - Can be collected from rocky outcrops, required to make anchors, very heavy
			Steel, Silver, Gold - Can be mined from islands? Dropped by characters, some aboard AI ships, etc?
			Consider adding animals - Sheep (Wool, Mutton), Cows (Milk, Beef)
			*Consider medical system - body part resources?* Surgeons/Physicians? Illness from islands (consider island towns and brothels)
			Ammunition/Gunpowder/Cannonballs? Start with some, craft from scrap metal or find on islands?
			More in-depth systems (type of food, type of coral, etc)?
			Rum - 
			Tobacco - 
		Tiles:
			Wooden Planks - weak, buoyant, light
			Offboard Motor? - heavy, fairly durable, requires scrap?
			Sail (multitile construction) - very large, fairly heavy, massive thrust. Can be climbed to provide lookout informaiton?
			Rudder (multitile construction) - fairly heavy, large torque from speed
			Anchor (multitile construction?) - very heavy, extreme thrust(drag)
			Metal hull (dynamic parttile? how to polygon?) - fairly heavy, extremely durable
			Spiked hull (dynamic parttile?) - fairly heavy, requires more metal, fairly durable, higher drag, deals more damage and grabs barrels?
			Bitts (mooring bollards) - heavy, can be used to tie mooring lines.
			Planks (multitile construction) - can be used for dry boarding (has no collisions~)
			Cannon (multitile construction) - very heavy, can be used to fire cannonballs.
			Mounted crossbow? - light, fairly fast fire rate, low damage
			Mini Trebuchet - fires barrels of oil and flaming arrows.....
			Stairs (multilevel construction) - used to transfer between layers
			Oar - allows for faster thrust than paddeling, has a task fulfillment. (single and double?)
			Bed/Bunk/Hammock - can be given for characters to sleep, helps keep them happy, consider day/night cycle?
			Table - used by characters to socialise
			Walls (dynamic parttile?) - used in layers to provide full protection
			Doors - used to seperate walls
			Windows - allows shooting though, boarding through is difficult.
			Low wall - used to act as some cover above deck.

			Sail rudder combo for very small boats?
			Drums - 
			Grapples - used to tether a boat to an enemy boat during a boarding operation
			Prison bars+doors? - used to create cages for prisoners
			Figurehead? - possibly design-your-own, send as Image.
		Task system notes/ideas:
			Deck swabbing - cleans boat
			Bail water - used to reduce flooding within the ship
			Dancing - 
		Animation system specs:
			Animations should be eventually be loaded in via a texture handler, where you can specify the size of the image and the number of frames.
			Animations should then be stored within the code, potentially as an ordered collection of BufferedImage?
			The animations should be drawn somehow, potentially from an Entity.draw() and Tile.draw() method, in which case the
				method queries various variables and decides upon the texture to return. (consider how to implement native JFrame
				animations?)
			Animations required:
				Characters:
					- swimming
					- walking
					- paddling(?)
					- building/constructing/working
				Water:
					- flowing
					- particles for motors/paddles?

Alpha 1.1 (Company Setup): [TODO]
		Set up the company or whatever we need to do
			I would like us to have a corporate meme because then we can be like a real company meme
			Perhaps we could in-corporate (ayy lmao) our names into the company name? HCH Games or something along those lines.
		Set up a bank that is in the company/corporate name
		Create an automated banking system so that shares of the money are debitted as we earn?
		Decide how much the game should be worth. I think that we should go around the £7-£13 bracket. Discuss this.
		Marketing - do we want to use advertisements? Facebook Page, Twitter, etc. Get PC Gamer to do a piece on it if poss? Send review copies
			to YouTubers?
		[R]: Could do, corporate meme might be a little harder on the paperwork side, idk tho, and need £40 to register as a Private Limited Company.
				Defo sounds like it'd be cooler tho, and yeah I dig HCH games, we just gotta argue over which H is which XD.
				As for automated banking that could be a good meme, the only issue might be that we need to deduct some cut to pay
				for dedis before the share split, so have to consider that. Also need to discuss which shares who is getting in this meme.
				Yeah i definitely think free review copies to a load of youtubers is a good idea. I was thinking aim it for like 9.99 to start,
					bear in mind we get 70% after tax so that'd be like £6 profit per sale maybe, which isn't too bad.
				Need to consider the whole steam meme - it'd cost £100 just to put the game on steam, however Java isn't natively compatible
				with the steam API. We'd have to use a JNI to interface with the Steamworks API, which considering we might use an external
				launcher anyways there's gonna be alot of external library memes. The only other alternatives are to either rewrite the entire
				thing in C. Which isn't happening. Or to use web APIs and OPENID to authenticate the users, however they will have to
				enter their steam details into our game in order to do that.
				
				Ait just gone and done some testing, got launch4j packing the .jar into a .exe just fine but I think we need to get steamworks
				before we can look at interfacing the steam API properly. However I did get it to compile fine with steamworks4j.
Alpha 1.0 (Initial Gameplay): [TODO]
		Clean up menus and everything to make it somewhat playable
		Begin paperwork for Steam direct steamworks (requires atleast 5 days review, 30 days processing, 2 weeks "coming soon")
		Test the game works on other platforms (other windows, mac, etc)
		Consider adding a launcher (detects java version, splashscreen built in, etc)
		Boat Destruction Mechanics:
		  Add mechanics for a player to restart from scratch if needed
-P- (R)	  Boat complete destruction should cause new boat respawn at random location?
		    Added after-death cam?. Need to handle respawn.
		    Death cam causes the clients graphics to freeze, also anyone who views the raft may freeze as well? not certain   
Alpha 1.1 (The Floating Update): [TODO]
		Add buoyancy mechanics, possibly consider how capsizing will work? 
		[discuss and implement mechanics for how more PCEs can be obtained?]
		Implement reefs
		Add mechanics for flooding and hull leakage, add collisions with islands and reefs
Alpha 1.2 (The Fleet Update): [TODO]
		Add mechanics to have multiple ships, and assigning PCEs to different boats?
		[discuss how boat assignment will work, color coded tasks for different boats?]
		Add boarding plank to allow PCEs to transfer between rafts
-PD-( )	Add character status effects (cold, wet) gained from swimming, lost over time?
		  Postponed as not important and may be better with event system.
		Add Anchor to keep rafts in place
		[begin discusson on how different resources will be obtained]
		[Boat destruction down the middle will need to cause fleeting in future?]
Alpha 1.3 (The Boat Update): [TODO]
		Add multilevelling so boats can be created.
		Add stairs to transfer between levels
		Discuss how water level can be displayed, consider adding a captains controller
			which adds GUI nautical information
		Consider how this will impact 2.5D
		Ensure boarding planks have the correct physics for this, consider adding a GUI element to compare vertical levels?
		Consider stability and how that will affect capsizing
		[discussion of pre-generated structures such a strongholds, ports, and dry docks]
Alpha 1.4 (The Fighting Update): [TODO]
		Implement hand-to-hand combat and pistols, perhaps give every PCE infinite ammo and a pistol by default.
		Consider adding boarding policies (kill all, take prisoners, take ship, etc)

List of discussion and decision points:
		[Decide how boat complete destruction will work]
			Immediately new boat? Need to be able to show death, Camera settings?

		[decide how PCE stats should work, random? guaranteed for 1st person? etc]
		[discuss PCE status effects - 'cold','wet'] Cool meme
		[find guys on islands to expand crew, start with small crew]
		[terrain tile system or polygonal?]
			Polygonal?
		[discuss how GUI will work, WASD always move? Perhaps need to select control mode?]
		[consider change in angular momentum when a block gets destroyed?]
		[consider adding static friction?]
		[decide how barrel spawning should work]
			Not important - current spawning is fine
		[Consider barrel spawning - if it occurs outside of raft view or player view?]
		[how to implement disconnection whilst in a server - 'ghost' ship raidable?]
		[how to implement ship destruction, abandonment, and hacking reporting systems?]
		[discuss barrel physics, barrel despawning, etc, global currents/winds?]
			Current physics fine? If/When to upgrade them?
		[add damage so barrels get destroyed?]
			Barrel destruction - textures to show damage?
			Destroy animation?
				Discuss tile destroy animation?
		[how to implement rejoin of players, and how overlapping will work, optional teleportation or waiting]
		[consider overhauling despawn and spawn system to have global barrel count and increase efficiency?]
		[discuss barrel-barrel and barrel-terrain collisions]
			Should they occur? Do they damage barrels? Yes, no damage
			They will need new physics sytem or else barrels will bounce around shorelines
			Should barrel collisions be based on midpoint or a set radius? Radius
			Barrels blown across beaches? Should collisions with terrain be based on graphical gradient or true gradient?
			Need to improve collisions - take relative velocities and implement a coefficient of restitution?
		[Consider overhauling texture system]
			Move from TileHandler to TextureHandler more, also upgrade TileHandler to assign coefficients?
		[Consider overhauling physics and packets system]
			Store UserData in a UserData handler.
			Make sure everything is queued. Add dummy packets for queued tasks.
			Consider reducing the number of packet types?
				Decide how best to sort packet by type, PacketTypeHandler?
			Move shared objects into shared folder, create clientside replicas where requried, or use static
				methods where required?
		[Discuss VAC integration]
		[Update display to show the tile and orientation of construction tile?]
			"That would be cool"
			Show the tile and orientation? Grayed out? Transparent?
			Should it also display on the task once clicked?
			Task icon for repair?
			Should repair have a layer of enforced transparency to cause holes in objects?
		[Discuss assert and keep in mind strictfp if needed, also discuss Predicates. Also discuss finally and return statements]
DONE	Consider pathfinding with dynamic targets - reach and recalculate? every second recalculate?
			Use Trace pathfinding algorithm, possibly best-first-search if not
			http://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/
		[Decide how new characters will be obtained]
			Stroll freely around boat
			Pickup off islands, spawn like barrels? Wander around?
DONE	[Consider how to implement thread-safe arrays]
			Array testing results: (see TestArea for full code, tests are done with 1,000 and 10,000 objects respectively)
			CopyOnWriteArrayList:
					small	small	large
			Create: 76		75		5343
			Predic: 3		4		9
			Iterat: 334		322		3013

		[Consider adding Location helper functions to compare locations]
		[Consider allowing building whilst on land to create defendable bases (Perhaps farmables? Perhaps mines?)]
TODODO		Check out from the depths
		[Consider AI-based rafts (transport rafts in fleeting, offensive rafts that can attack, etc)]
		[Consider overhauling rotation and drag system (rot.damage and drag should apply to 1-tile rafts, rafts should not spin
			wildly on shorelines, perhaps use reefs to do this?]
		[Decide how to handle auto-tasks, add listeners for them? hardcode?]

List of in-depth notes for decision points:

		?	note: ec.sendState() will sync client and server side, and is only called on init of the task.
				If a task variable changes, ec.sendState() should be called to sync with the server.
				Perhaps consider adding an annotation listener here?
		#	have targetReached() method when a target is reached,
				prompts retargetting or task cancellation.
		?	have isInterrupted boolean
				can be set by any method, if true the task will be unassigned and added back to the task queue.?
			notes:
			pathfinding tasks wil use the slowPassiveUpdate() and slowUpdate() methods to reset the path each
				second. execute() will simply follow the path. (list is a queue of locations, execute() targets the
				head of this list, targetReached() pulls the next head to the target location and procedes as normal. If
				targetReached() pulls nothing it is assumed that the target is the next target, and targetReached() will point directly
				to the target. If the entity is within 0.1 of the targets position it is assumed that it is reached and finalTargetReached()
				is called????
			entityCharacter has moveToward(Location loc) method. It will move toward the location specified as far as collisions will allow
				it, if it would fall in water then it will fall in water.
			Location loc:
				VectorDouble pos;
				boolean isAbsolute;
				String raft_uuid; //if not absolute
		
	#	Event System:
			https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Event_API_Reference
			List of events to implement:
			-TileDamageEvent (depending on tilestate system perhaps TileStateChangeEvent and/or TileDamageEvent only fires on 25HP boundry)
				Fired when a tile takes damage, contains a reference to the tile, the raft it belongs to, the previous HP?, etc (potentially damagecause)
				fired (queued?) when damage() is called on a tile {shared PhysicsHandler required? Move damage function to physics handlers?}
			-TileBrokenEvent
				Fired when a tile is broken critically (when damage() is called, after TileDamageEvent is fired)
			-TileBuiltEvent
				Fired when a tile is built? (not currently necessary?)
			Events are fired by creating the event and calling .fire();
			Events are executed in the .fire() function, immediately.
			Events search for classes that are registed, extend Listener, and find their @EventHandler annotations.
			Events iterate through the list using Priority, until there are no more listeners.
			
			
			
			
			
	
#Leave room here for future alpha iterations, testing and implementing minor features until it is ready for release

Ideas
	Camera control
		Camera centres on player
			If player starts to drive a raft, the camera zooms out and recentres on the raft
		Camera can be set to centre on other rafts through binds (e.g. F1 for boat 1, F2 for boat 2, etc)
		Camera can be set to 3 modes - rotate with entity, rotate on click and drag, or fixed
		Click and drag may not be necessary or good
		
	Player control
		Under fixed cam
			Twin stick - wasd for movement, mouse for look (like hotline miami)
		Under rotate with entity
			wasd where a and d turn
		Under click and drag
			wasd for movement and click and drag for turn


Beta 1.0 (Public Gameplay): [TODO]
		Release the game on steam in a playable format
Beta 1.1 (Tidying up): [TODO]
		Add Controller support
		Use user feedback to debug
Beta 1.2 (The Modding Update): [TODO]
		Decide on modding platform
			Steam Workshop
			Nexus Mods (Dusk preference on this platform - nexus is really nice and well-used by the modding community - especially for skyrim and
				fallout)
			Custom Platform?
			Other...
		Add ability to mod in a viable way
		Create a mod forum? (Probably unnecessary if we use a pre-existing platform)
