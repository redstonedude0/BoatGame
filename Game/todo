Alpha 0.9 (The Intelligence Update): [TODO]
		Minor fixes:
-PR-	  Player controlled entities fall in water if they are no longer on a block
-PD-	  Boat complete destruction should cause new boat respawn at random location?
		Efficiency enhancements:
-P-		  Change everything to use floats instead of doubles
		Error handling:
-P-	[R]	  Wrap packet handlers in try catches to prevent thread crashes [disconnect client]
-P-	[R]	  Move createNewListener server-side to playerJoin to fix comod exceptions
		PCE Stats sytem:
-D-		  Implement PCE stats system [walk speed, swim speed]?
-D-		  Add character status effects (cold, wet) gained from swimming, lost over time?
		Task System Updates:
	[R]	  Overhaul task system
	[R]	  Add construction time (make construction a lasting task)
-R-	(R)	  Make thrusters require 2 wood
	[R]	  Add repair task? [automatically added? option in GUI?]
			Automatically adds repair task, no option currently. Consider if block doesn't exist, consider removing if block is
			destroyed. Consider adding better listeners and possibly a wrapper for Tiles
	[R]  Update Wander task to account for characters being in water.
			Allows them to reside on a fake square at 0,0 however.
-R-	(R)	  Add paddelling task, must be placed adjacent to empty spot, can be rotated
-D-	(R)	  Paddelling task is cancellable, make all other tasks cancellable
			How to cancel? Rightclick with any task selected?
	(R)	  Implement paddelling, take it into account for control and physics calculations.
			Paddelling will apply a force proportional to the difference in speed from 1ms^-1, it will never accelerate above 1ms^-1
			Perhaps set as unreachable if speed difference is too great?
	[R]	  Make intelligent task selection? (take into account distance, swim/walk speeds)
			Priority for each task from getPriority() method, lowest priority is done first. (must be >=0)
	[R]	  Intelligent dismounting (pathfinding not currently necessary)
	(R)	  If a task would require dismounting a boat moving at more then 1ms^-1 then set it as unreachable
	(R)	  Consider adding try-catch around all execute()s to ensure that pathfinding is fine, else set as unreachable?
	(R)	  Implement custom Priority class where you have PriorityType (Critical, Normal, Low), and a int priorityModifier. Allows more
			in-depth setting of Priorities (i.e. repairs always come above building, etc)
		  Overhaul rest of packet and physics system to work with Location better.
		GUI Updates:
-P-	[R]	  Update GUI to be graphical based on buttons
	[R]	  Make main menu GUI
	[R]	  Add larger worldmap, openable in the GUI.
-D-		  Add GUI scale into a graphics settings page?

	[R]	  Add GUI to show list of tasks, etc
-D-		  Add debug GUI
-D-		  Implement server-side chat?
			Need to decide how to handle focus & modification of chatqueue
		Camera Updates:
-D-		  Add scrolling to world scale?
-R-		  Add a hard render limit on ships to save GPU, also add fog of war to show approximately this limit (-20 perhaps?)
		  Update Camera to be able to track other objects
-P-	[R]   Rotation soft follow?
		Investigate barrel 'worm' at t=0
		  Investigation so far - it still exists, not sure how to reproduce it though. Possibly always in direction of wind?
	(R)	Investigate black flash when resizing frame
		  Investigation 1 - Not found, possibly solved with new fps method
		  Inv 2 - ""
	(R)	Investigate 1 frame flash when clicking GUI buttons
		  Investigation 1 - Not found, possibly solved with new fps method
		  Inv 2 - ""
	[R]	Investigate ghost damage from barrels
			Appears to occur as 1 client doesn't acknowledge a barrel dissapearing, make sure only doing collisions for own raft
	[R]	Investigate raft reset to 0,0 on disconnect?
			Caused by non-synchronous methods, fixed.
		Investigate Socket write errors on disconnect?
	[R]	Investigate barrel clicking not being 100% accurate on small view
			possibly due to the null errors that were fixed with null checks and a sync. Probably not.
			Investigation 1 - not found; possibly fixed
			Investigation 2 - found, source not identified. Checked code - no reason why it shouldn't work. Possibly sync bug.
	(RD)Investigate latency issues. Consider measuring packets, consider writeUnshared testing.
			Consider offloading packet transfer to client-side calculations. esp. for AI.
			Investigation 1 - Local latency issues fixed with fps rewrite. Need to analyse WAN latency.
	[R]	Investigate Task delay - takes a second to take up a task? (due to random selection each time - should be fixed with
			priority system implementation). With new system task delay is near 0.
	[R]	Investigate task speed reduction
			Improved graphics display method to reliably achieve 40-50fps. Consider seperating graphics and physics into seperate
			thread or pseudo-seperate threads.
-D-		Consider implications of making join and disconnect synchronized now, consider other ways around this, consider removing
			"socket closed" error on server shutdown
-D-	(R)	Consider queueing input controls
-D-		Consider adding .send() to packets?
-D	(R)	Consider overhaul of array handling and consider event listeners
-D-	(R)	Decide how to implement resource requirement system + other resources, consider TileHandler and enums
-D-		Consider adding drag interface for multiple task creation/deletion
Alpha 0.91 (The Sounds [and camera?] Update): [TODO]
		Decide on sound design
		Make the music and sounds as necessary
		Add a way to trigger sounds and music on events in the code
Alpha 0.92 (Company Setup): [TODO]
		Set up the company or whatever we need to do
			I would like us to have a corporate meme because then we can be like a real company meme
			Perhaps we could in-corporate (ayy lmao) our names into the company name? HCH Games or something along those lines.
		Set up a bank that is in the company/corporate name
		Create an automated banking system so that shares of the money are debitted as we earn?
		Decide how much the game should be worth. I think that we should go around the £7-£13 bracket. Discuss this.
		Marketing - do we want to use advertisements? Facebook Page, Twitter, etc. Get PC Gamer to do a piece on it if poss? Send review copies
			to YouTubers?
		[R]: Could do, corporate meme might be a little harder on the paperwork side, idk tho, and need £40 to register as a Private Limited Company.
				Defo sounds like it'd be cooler tho, and yeah I dig HCH games, we just gotta argue over which H is which XD.
				As for automated banking that could be a good meme, the only issue might be that we need to deduct some cut to pay
				for dedis before the share split, so have to consider that. Also need to discuss which shares who is getting in this meme.
				Yeah i definitely think free review copies to a load of youtubers is a good idea. I was thinking aim it for like 9.99 to start,
					bear in mind we get 70% after tax so that'd be like £6 profit per sale maybe, which isn't too bad.
				Need to consider the whole steam meme - it'd cost £100 just to put the game on steam, however Java isn't natively compatible
				with the steam API. We'd have to use a JNI to interface with the Steamworks API, which considering we might use an external
				launcher anyways there's gonna be alot of external library memes. The only other alternatives are to either rewrite the entire
				thing in C. Which isn't happening. Or to use web APIs and OPENID to authenticate the users, however they will have to
				enter their steam details into our game in order to do that.
				
				Ait just gone and done some testing, got launch4j packing the .jar into a .exe just fine but I think we need to get steamworks
				before we can look at interfacing the steam API properly. However I did get it to compile fine with steamworks4j.
Alpha 1.0 (Initial Gameplay): [TODO]
		Clean up menus and everything to make it somewhat playable
		Begin paperwork for Steam direct steamworks (requires atleast 5 days review, 30 days processing, 2 weeks "coming soon")
		Test the game works on other platforms (other windows, mac, etc)
		Consider adding a launcher (detects java version, splashscreen built in, etc)
Alpha 1.1 (The Floating Update): [TODO]
		Add buoyancy mechanics, possibly consider how capsizing will work?
		Add mechanics for a player to restart from scratch if needed
		[discuss and implement mechanics for how more PCEs can be obtained?]
		Implement reefs
		Add mechanics for flooding and hull leakage, add collisions with islands and reefs
Alpha 1.2 (The Fleet Update): [TODO]
		Add mechanics to have multiple ships, and assigning PCEs to different boats?
		[discuss how boat assignment will work, color coded tasks for different boats?]
		Add boarding plank to allow PCEs to transfer between rafts
		Add Anchor to keep rafts in place
		[begin discusson on how different resources will be obtained]
		[Boat destruction down the middle will need to cause fleeting in future?]
Alpha 1.3 (The Boat Update): [TODO]
		Add multilevelling so boats can be created.
		Add stairs to transfer between levels
		Discuss how water level can be displayed, consider adding a captains controller
			which adds GUI nautical information
		Consider how this will impact 2.5D
		Ensure boarding planks have the correct physics for this, consider adding a GUI element to compare vertical levels?
		Consider stability and how that will affect capsizing
		[discussion of pre-generated structures such a strongholds, ports, and dry docks]
Alpha 1.4 (The Fighting Update): [TODO]
		Implement hand-to-hand combat and pistols, perhaps give every PCE infinite ammo and a pistol by default.


List of discussion and decision points:
		[Decide how boat complete destruction will work]
			Immediately new boat? Need to be able to show death, Camera settings?
		[discuss PCE stats system]
		[decide how PCE stats should work, random? guaranteed for 1st person? etc]
		[discuss PCE status effects - 'cold','wet']
		[terrain tile system or polygonal?]
		[discuss how GUI will work, WASD always move? Perhaps need to select control mode?]
		[consider change in angular momentum when a block gets destroyed?]
		[consider adding static friction?]
		[decide how barrel spawning should work]
			#Not important - current spawning is fine
		[how to implement disconnection whilst in a server - 'ghost' ship raidable?]
		[how to implement ship destruction, abandonment, and hacking reporting systems?]
		[discuss barrel physics, barrel despawning, etc, global currents/winds?]
			Current physics fine? If/When to upgrade them?
		[add damage so barrels get destroyed?]
			Barrel destruction - textures to show damage?
			Destroy animation?
				Discuss tile destroy animation?
		[how to implement rejoin of players, and how overlapping will work, optional teleportation or waiting]
		[consider overhauling despawn and spawn system to have global barrel count and increase efficiency?]
		[discuss barrel-barrel and barrel-terrain collisions]
			Should they occur? Do they damage barrels?
			They will need new physics sytem or else barrels will bounce around shorelines
			Should barrel collisions be based on midpoint or a set radius?
			Barrels blown across beaches? Should collisions with terrain be based on graphical gradient or true gradient?
			Need to improve collisions - take relative velocities and implement a coefficient of restitution?
		[Consider overhauling texture system]
			Move from TileHandler to TextureHandler more, also upgrade TileHandler to assign coefficients?
		[Consider overhauling physics and packets system]
			Store UserData in a UserData handler.
			Make sure everything is queued. Add dummy packets for queued tasks.
			Consider reducing the number of packet types?
				Decide how best to sort packet by type, PacketTypeHandler?
			Move shared objects into shared folder, create clientside replicas where requried, or use static
				methods where required?
		[Discuss VAC integration]
		[Update display to show the tile and orientation of construction tile?]
			Show the tile and orientation? Grayed out? Transparent?
			Should it also display on the task once clicked?
			Task icon for repair?
			Should repair have a layer of enforced transparency to cause holes in objects?
		[Discuss assert and keep in mind strictfp if needed, also discuss Predicates]
		Consider pathfinding with dynamic targets - reach and recalculate? every second recalculate?
			Use Trace pathfinding algorithm, possibly best-first-search if not
			http://qiao.github.io/PathFinding.js/visual/

List of in-depth notes for decision points:
		Pathfinding [+Task overhaul]:
			http://jabelarminecraft.blogspot.co.uk/p/minecraft-forge-1721710-custom-entity-ai.html
			{Consider Mutex bits to prevent similar tasks from executing}
		#	execute() method called each tick on the AI while it is being executed
			[decide exactly how dynamic targetting will work]
		#	Store dynamic targets as an Entity pointer, create EntityWrapper to hold entities properly
		#	have passiveUpdate() method to update an AI when its not being run -
				used to ????
		#	have slowPassiveUpdate() method to update an AI on more resource-intensive things;
				used to check if target still exists and is allowed?
				Used to update path for target? [check if reachable]
		#	have slowUpdate() method to update an AI when its being run -
				used to update target and path?
		#	have isCompleted boolean
				can be set by any method (passiveUpdate, execute, slowUpdate), if true the task will
				immediately be removed from the list or removed from the tasked entity.
		#	have isEligible(Entity e) method to see if an entity is eligible for this task
				false and the task won't be taken up, true and Entity e will be tasked with this task
		#	have init() method
				Called as soon as the task is assigned to an entity, used to setup any variables required
				before execution.
		#	have TaskHandler.assignTask() method, assigns a random? task to an entity.
				#will be replaced with TaskHandler.assignTasks() and Task.getEligibility() for smart task selection (once per second though?)
		?	note: ec.sendState() will sync client and server side, and is only called on init of the task.
				If a task variable changes, ec.sendState() should be called to sync with the server.
				Perhaps consider adding an annotation listener here?
		#	have targetReached() method when a target is reached,
				prompts retargetting or task cancellation.
		?	have isInterrupted boolean
				can be set by any method, if true the task will be unassigned and added back to the task queue.?
			notes:
			pathfinding tasks wil use the slowPassiveUpdate() and slowUpdate() methods to reset the path each
				second. execute() will simply follow the path. (list is a queue of locations, execute() targets the
				head of this list, targetReached() pulls the next head to the target location and procedes as normal. If
				targetReached() pulls nothing it is assumed that the target is the next target, and targetReached() will point directly
				to the target. If the entity is within 0.1 of the targets position it is assumed that it is reached and finalTargetReached()
				is called????
			entityCharacter has moveToward(Location loc) method. It will move toward the location specified as far as collisions will allow
				it, if it would fall in water then it will fall in water.
			Location loc:
				VectorDouble pos;
				boolean isAbsolute;
				String raft_uuid; //if not absolute
			
			
			
			
	
#Leave room here for future alpha iterations, testing and implementing minor features until it is ready for release

Ideas
	Camera control
		Camera centres on player
			If player starts to drive a raft, the camera zooms out and recentres on the raft
		Camera can be set to centre on other rafts through binds (e.g. F1 for boat 1, F2 for boat 2, etc)
		Camera can be set to 3 modes - rotate with entity, rotate on click and drag, or fixed
		Click and drag may not be necessary or good
		
	Player control
		Under fixed cam
			Twin stick - wasd for movement, mouse for look (like hotline miami)
		Under rotate with entity
			wasd where a and d turn
		Under click and drag
			wasd for movement and click and drag for turn


Beta 1.0 (Public Gameplay): [TODO]
		Release the game on steam in a playable format
Beta 1.1 (Tidying up): [TODO]
		Add Controller support
		Use user feedback to debug
Beta 1.2 (The Modding Update): [TODO]
		Decide on modding platform
			Steam Workshop
			Nexus Mods (Dusk preference on this platform - nexus is really nice and well-used by the modding community - especially for skyrim and
				fallout)
			Custom Platform?
			Other...
		Add ability to mod in a viable way
		Create a mod forum?
